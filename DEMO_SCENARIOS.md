- Immediate need for risk mitigation

### **Medium-Priority Targets (Score 70-84)**
- Recent citations/violations
- Some injury or near-miss events
- Good rehabilitation opportunities
- Proactive risk management discussions

### **Low-Priority Targets (Score 50-69)**

## üéØ **Target Personas & Decision Makers**

### **Primary Targets:**
- **VPs of Risk Management** at major GCs and property owners
- **Chief Safety Officers** at construction companies
- **Procurement Directors** managing subcontractor relationships
- **Insurance/Surety Brokers** working with these companies

### **Pain Points RiskRadar Solves:**
1. **Reactive Response**: Currently only learn about sub incidents after damage is done
2. **Limited Visibility**: No systematic way to monitor sub safety performance
3. **Manual Processes**: Prequal and risk assessment is time-intensive
4. **Reputation Risk**: Sub incidents reflect on GC/Owner safety programs
5. **Insurance Costs**: Poor sub safety records drive up premiums

## üí∞ **Business Impact**

### **Revenue Opportunity per Account:**
- **Major GCs**: $150K - $400K annually
- **Large Property Owners**: $100K - $300K annually
- **Insurance/Surety**: $50K - $200K annually

### **Sales Process:**
1. **Trigger Event**: Recent subcontractor incident (RiskRadar identifies)
2. **Initial Outreach**: "Noticed your recent sub incident, here's how to prevent future ones"
3. **Demo**: Show their specific data, incidents, and risk patterns
4. **Pilot**: 30-60 day pilot monitoring their key subcontractors
5. **Full Deployment**: Annual contract with expanded monitoring

## üìà **Metrics That Matter**

### **Leading Indicators:**
- Number of subcontractor incidents identified
- Speed of incident detection (hours vs. weeks)
- Quality of risk intelligence provided

### **Customer Success Metrics:**
- Reduction in sub-related incidents
- Improved prequal process efficiency
- Better subcontractor safety performance
- Enhanced risk visibility and control
